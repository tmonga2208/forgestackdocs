# Introduction to ForgeStack  

Welcome to **ForgeStack**, a Firebase-focused stack template built with **Next.js**. ForgeStack simplifies the development of serverless applications by providing pre-configured Firebase integrations, custom hooks, and a scalable architecture. 

## So... what is `create-forgestack`? A template?

Basically...Yeah!  `create-forgestack` is a CLI built by [Tarun](https://tmonga2208.vercel.app/), A Firebase and Next.js developer to help you spin up a modular, production-ready stack — fast. It's not a bloated boilerplate. It's a curated setup that gives you full control over what matters.
Each part of ForgeStack is intentional. The stack is opinionated about structure and integration, but modular where it counts. You get solid defaults (Firebase, Tailwind, Shadcn/UI, theming, custom hooks), and the flexibility to extend things your way.

This is **not** an all-in-one, solves-everything-for-you template. We expect you to bring your own tools for things like state management, data fetching layers, and deployment strategies. We're not here to lock you into "one way" — we just want to give you a really good head start.
We’ve built dozens of Firebase projects, large and small, and this stack reflects what we've learned (sometimes the hard way). `create-forgestack` is our way of helping you skip the grunt work and get straight to building.
